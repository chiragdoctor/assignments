3) Explain the difference between file soft links and hard links by creating one. Demonstrate with an example file.

Softlinks
- Soflinks are also called as symbolic links. They are symbolic links to original file. 
- They can be created cross file system. 
- Has different inode number and permissions.
- permissions will not be updated. 
- has only path of original file and not the content. Once the orignal file is deleted no contents will be shown. 
- Command: ln -s sourcefile destinationfile

Hardlinks
- They are mirror images of original file. 
- Cannot cross file system boundies
- can't link directories 
- has the same inode number and file permissions
- Has the content of the original file even if the original file is moved or deleted.
- Command: ln sourcefile destinationfile

r w x               r w x               r w x
1 1 1               0 0 0               0 0 0
