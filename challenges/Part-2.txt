7) 

First Less Than and Greater Than operator works from left to right

console.log(1 < 2 < 3) // true
This is true because 1 < 2 == true and true < 3, as bools are represented in 1's and 0's and true == 1
hence it is evalutated as 1 < 3 == true

console.log(3 > 2 > 1) // false

Similar to previous example 3 > 2 == true and true > 3 which evals to 1 > 1 but it is actually equal to
1. hence it comes to false.

8) 

var myArray = ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd'];
myArray.unshift('start');
myArray.push('end');

9) 

a) No

b) undefined

c) undefined


10) 

1) 0 || 1 = 1. Using OR operator as first condition is false it will evaluate second condition, hence 1.

2) 1 || 2 = 1. As first condition evals to true it does not go to second condition. 

3) 0 && 1 = 0. using AND operator if the first condition evals false it returns from the first condition.

4) check question 


11) undefined, x will he hoisted in the getGirl function and will be assigned to undefined. 

12) true, both of them are undefined.
